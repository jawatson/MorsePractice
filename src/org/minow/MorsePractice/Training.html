  Training</font></h2>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">To learn Morse Code using random
  symbols and the Koch method, train in this order:</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">K M R S U A P T L O<br>
  W I . N J E F 0 Y ,<br>
  V G 5 / Q 9 Z H 3 8<br>
  B ? 4 2 7 C 1 D 6 X<br>
  BT or =<br>
  SK or +<br>
  AR or #<br></font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Set the code speed fairly high using
  'Farnsworth' spacing and train on the selected characters until you
  are at least 90% correct for a 5 minute sequence, then add the next
  character. The Koch Training Sequence field shows the characters in
  the recommended training order.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">To start training, select the symbol
  set, sending speed, and training duration, then click on the \"Random
  Trial\" button. You will hear five short beeps, before the training
  begins. (If you don't select any symbol, the program will use the
  entire Morse Code set.)</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">After the training completes, type
  what you heard into the text box, using '~' as a placeholder for
  characters you missed, then click on the 'Check' button to see the
  results.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">The program can save your training
  results in a 'student workbook' file. (Analysis programs haven't been
  written yet.) MorsePractice saves your training set and speed
  parameters in a parameter file named MorsePractice.txt.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">You can also listen to QSO's (amateur
  radio contacts) generated using a random grammar. These follow the
  format used in the United States for license examinations. When you
  select the 'Random QSO' option, MorsePractice will synthesize a QSO,
  then display it in the text area. By the way, the callsigns are not
  necessarily real and don't always match the license class: a novice
  might have an 'Amateur Extra' license. Similarly, you should expect
  other inconsistencies, such as a 13 year-old retired politician. The
  program uses your current sending speed to select between a short,
  medium, and long QSO, or you can select one of the three lengths
  directly.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">You will have to check your listening
  ability yourself: the 'Check' button only works for random symbol
  training since, for high speeds, you should be listening for content,
  and will not be concerned with the exact symbols that MorsePractice
  sends.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Additional random symbol training
  options concentrate on symbols of various lengths, digits, and
  punctuation and prosigns, or amateur call signs. After listening to
  the sequence, type what you heard and click the 'Check' button to get
  your score.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial"Random symbol training is based on the Koch training sequence,
  described by David Finley;</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">The Koch method is also described in the book, "The Art and Skill
  of Radio-telegraphy," by William G. Peirpoint, N0HFF, as distributed
  on the Web in a number of locations including;</font></p>
